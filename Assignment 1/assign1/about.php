				in creating the site that should be known about:

						he/she can know which fields need to be corrected.</li>
						<li>The use of PHP multidimensional arrays to handle the 
						searching, sorting and displaying process of the file's content.</li>
						<li>The use of PHP custom functions to help with the required tasks.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
