        <ul>
            <li>The tasks I have not attempted or not completed:
                <ul>
                    <li> I have tried my best to complete all of the tasks available, including challenges. However, I'm not sure if all tasks are perfect, as I'm still in the process of learning</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Special features I have done, or attempted,
                in creating the site that should be known about:
                <ul>
                    <li>I attempted to create a navigation bar. However, with the assignment website model, a navigation bar prove to be not needed. Thus, the only place that show it is friendlist.php and friendadd.php where user must logged in. And it will only display a simple "Hello, user".</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The parts I had trouble with:
                <ul>
                    <li>I would say that having to find a running SQL that match the Task 9 Description is the hardest. Not only I have to list all of friends in both account, I also have to somehow find duplicate friend between two of them and display the number of mutual friends.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The things I want to do better next time:
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to write cleaner code in PHP and HTML, and maybe find a better way to utilize both PHP and MySQL.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The additional features I added to the assignment:
                <ul>
                    <li>A simple Hello User when users are logged in. Nothing more beside that, as I was running out of time</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
